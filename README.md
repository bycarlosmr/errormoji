# 😤 ➡️ 🤣

Errors can be frustrating, but could they also be fun?

This repo is inspired by a [random tweet](https://twitter.com/minebocek/status/1035377949036486656) of mine which made me realize that there are others out there who enjoy emoji puzzles.

Deciphering errors can be difficult and frustrating, but maybe seeing them in emoji form would help lighten things a bit?

Note that I'm not suggesting we replace R errors with emojis (that might make them even more frustrating!), but I can see a venue for these in blog posts, class notes, talks, etc.

The translations are organized in two groups:

- `verbose = FALSE`: without any explanation
- `verbose = TRUE`: some explanation on where the error comes from, why it might be happening, and how it might be resolved

If you have suggestions for R error/emoji translations to add or want to request a translation, please see the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTE.md).
